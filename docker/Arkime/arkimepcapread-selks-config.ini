# Latest settings documentation: https://github.com/aol/moloch/wiki/Settings
#
# Moloch uses a tiered system for configuration variables.  This allows Moloch
# to share one config file for many machines.  The ordering of sections in this
# file doesn't matter.
#
# Order of config variables:
# 1st) [optional] The section titled with the node name is used first.
#      Moloch will always tag sessions with node:<node name>
# 2nd) [optional] If a node has a nodeClass variable, the section titled with
#      the nodeClass name is used next.  Sessions will be tagged with
#      node:<node class name> which is useful if watching different
#      network classes.
# 3rd) The section titled "default" is used last.
