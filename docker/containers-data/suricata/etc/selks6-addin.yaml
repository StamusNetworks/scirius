## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allow us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory on an
# efficient way keeping a good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom
# make sure to define the values at "- custom-values" as your convenience.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  On not specifying a value, we use no limits on the recursion.

  # If set to yes, the loading of signatures will be made after the capture
  # is started. This will limit the downtime in IPS mode.

  prefilter:
    # default prefiltering setting. "mpm" only creates MPM/fast_pattern
    # engines. "auto" also sets up prefilter engines for other keywords.
    # Use --list-keywords=all to see which keywords support prefiltering.
    default: auto

  # the grouping values above control how many groups are created per
  # direction. Port whitelisting forces that port to get it's own group.
  # Very common ports will benefit, as well as ports with many expensive
  # rules.

    tcp-whitelist: 53, 80, 139, 443, 445, 1433, 3306, 3389, 6666, 6667, 8080
