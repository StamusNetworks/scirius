Introduction
============

Scirius is a web interface dedicated to Suricata ruleset management.
It handles the rules file and update associated files.

Scirius is developed by `Stamus Networks <https://www.stamus-networks.com/>`_ and is available under the
GNU GPLv3 license.

Installation and setup
======================

Installing Scirius
------------------

Scirius is an application written in `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_. You can install
it like any other Django application.

The following procedure has been tested on Debian Wheezy and Sid and Ubuntu LTS 12.04.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scirius is using the following Django modules:

* tables2
* south
* bootstrap3
* requests
* revproxy

The easy way to install the dependencies is to use `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_:

On Debian, you can run ::

 aptitude install python-pip python-dev

You can then install django and the dependencies ::

 pip install -r requirements.txt

To use the suri_reloader script which is handling suricata restart, you will also need
pyinotify ::

 pip install pyinotify

It has been reported that on some Debian system forcing a recent GitPython is required ::

 pip install gitpython==0.3.1-beta2

You will also potentially needs the gitdb module ::

 pip install gitdb

Running Scirius
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the source, then inside the source ::

 python manage.py syncdb

Authentication is by default in scirius so you will need to create a superuser
account when proposed.

One of the easiest way to try Scirius is to run the Django test server ::

 python manage.py runserver

You can then connect to ``localhost:8000``.

If you need the application to listen to a reachable address, you can run
something like ::

 python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.1:8000

Suricata setup
--------------

Scirius is generating one single rules files with all activated rules. When editing
the Suricata object, you have to setup the directory where you want this file to be generated
and the associated files of the ruleset to be copied.

Scirius won't touch your Suricata configuration file aka ``suricata.yaml``. So you have
to update it to point to the directory where data are setup by Scirius. If you are
only using rules generated by Scirius, you should have something looking like in
your ``suricata.yaml`` file ::

 default-rule-path: /path/to/rules
 rule-files:
  - scirius.rules

To interact with Scirius, you need to detect when ``/path/to/rules/scirius.reload`` file
are created, initiate a reload or restart of Suricata when it is the case and delete the
reload file once this is done.

One possible way to do that is to use ``suri_reloader`` available in ``suricata/scripts``
directory. The syntax of ``suri_reloader`` can be something similar to ::

 suri_reloader -p /path/to/rules  -l /var/log/suri-reload.log  -D

Use ``-h`` option to get the complete list of options. Please note that ``suri_reloaded``
uses the ``service`` command to restart or reload Suricata. This means you need a init
script to get it working.

Link with Elasticsearch
-----------------------

If you are using Suricata with Eve logging and Elasticsearch, you can get information
about signatures displayed in the page showing information about Suricata:

.. image:: https://github.com/StamusNetworks/scirius/raw/master/doc/images/suricata-display.png
    :alt: elasticsearch info in scirius
    :align: center

You can also get graph and details about a specific rule:

.. image:: https://github.com/StamusNetworks/scirius/raw/master/doc/images/rule-detail.png
    :alt: rule info in scirius
    :align: center

To setup Elasticsearch connection, you can edit ``settings.py`` or create a
``local_settings.py`` file under ``scirius`` directory to setup the feature.
Elasticsearch is activated if a variable names ``USE_ELASTICSEARCH`` is set
to True in ``settings.py``. The address of the Elasticsearch is stored in the
``ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS`` variable and uses the format ``IP:port``.

For example, if your Elasticsearch is running locally, you can add
to ``local_settings.py`` ::

 USE_ELASTICSEARCH = True
 ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1:9200"

Please note, that the name of the Suricata (set during edition of the object) must
be equal to the ``host`` key present in Elasticsearch events.

Link with Kibana
----------------

If you are using Kibana, it is possible to get links to your dashboards by clicking the
top left icon:

.. image:: https://github.com/StamusNetworks/scirius/raw/master/doc/images/kibana-link.png
    :alt: kibana dropdown menu
    :align: center

To activate the feature, you need to edit your `local_settings.py` file: ::

 KIBANA_URL = "http://localhost/"
 USE_KIBANA = True

Usage
=====

Authentication and permissions
------------------------------

Scirius is using authentication by default. You will need a superuser to be able to
create and edit users for scirius. ``syncdb`` should have created one for you. If it is not
the case, you can run from Scirius base directory ::

 python manage.py createsuperuser

The base directory is the directory where scirius sources have been extracted. If
you are using SELKS this is ``/opt/selks/scirius``.

You will then be able to connect using the provided credentials.

Permissions system is basic:

* Superuser can edit and create users
* Staff members can do change on rulesets and suricata

This allows to have three useful levels for users:

* Read-only: no flag set
* Staff member: with staff flag set, they can update rulesets and suricata
* Super user: flags staff and superuser set, they can do anything

Ruleset management
------------------

A Ruleset is made of components selected in different Sources. A Source is a set of
files providing information to Suricata. For example, this can EmergingThreats ruleset.

To create a ruleset, you thus must create a set of Sources and then link them to the
ruleset. Once this is done, you can select which elements of the source you want to
use. For example, in the case of a signature ruleset, you can select which categories
you want to use and which individual signature you want do disable.

Once a Ruleset is defined, you can attach it to your Suricata. To do that simply edit
the Suricata object and choose the Ruleset in the list.

Creating Source
---------------

To create a Source go to ``Sources -> Add`` (``Add`` being in the
``Actions`` menu in the sidebar). Then set the different fields and click ``Submit``.

A source of datatype ``Signatures files in tar archive`` has to follow some rules:

* It must be a tar archive
* All files must be under a ``rules`` directory

For example, if you want to fetch ETOpen Ruleset for Suricata 2.0.1, you can use:

* Name: ETOpen Ruleset
* URI: https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-2.0.1/emerging.rules.tar.gz

A source of datatype ``Individual signature files`` has to be a single file containing
signatures.

For example, if you want to use SSL blacklist from abuse.ch, you can use:

* Name: SSLBL abuse.ch
* URI: https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.rules

Updating Source
---------------

To update a Source, you first need to select it. To do that, go to ``Sources`` then
select the wanted Source in the array.

You can then click on ``Update`` in the menu in the sidebar. This step can take long
as it can require some download and heavy parsing.

Once updated, you can browse the result by following links in the array.

Creating Ruleset
----------------

To create a Ruleset go to ``Ruleset -> Add`` (``Add`` being in the
``Actions`` menu in the sidebar). Then set the name of the Ruleset
and choose which Sources to use and click ``Submit``.

Updating Ruleset
----------------

To update a Ruleset, you first need to select it. To do that, go to ``Ruleset`` then
select the wanted Ruleset in the array.

You can then click on ``Update`` in the ``Action`` menu in the sidebar. This step can take long
as it can require download of different Sources and heavy parsing.

Editing Ruleset
---------------

To edit a Ruleset, you first need to select it. To do that, go to ``Ruleset`` then
select the wanted Ruleset in the array.

You can then click on ``Edit`` in the ``Action`` menu in the sidebar. 

There is now different operations available in the ``Action`` menu

* Edit sources: select which sources of signatures to use in the Ruleset
* Edit categories: select which categories of signatures to use in the Ruleset
* Add rule to suppressed list: if a rule is in this list then it will not be part of the generated Ruleset
* Remove rule from suppressed list: this remove a rule from the previously mentioned list thus reenabling it in the Ruleset

Edit Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To select which Sources to use, just select them via the checkbox and click on ``Update sources``. Please
note that selecting categories to enable is the next step in the process when you add a new source.

Edit Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To select which Categories to use, just select them via the checkbox and click on ``Update categories``.

Add rule to suppressed list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the search field to find the rule(s) you want to remove, you can use the SID or any other element in the signature. Scirius will search the entered text in the definition of signature and return you the list of rules.
You will then be able to remove them by clicking on the check boxes and clicking on ``Add selected rules to suppressed list``.

Remove rule from suppressed list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove rules from suppressed list, simply check them in the array and click on ``Remove select rules from suppressed list``.

Thresholding
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suricata features one thresholding system. It allows to change the behavior of a given alert. There is
currently two different operations supported by Scirius:

* Suppress: suppress alert for a signature when IP source or IP destination is in a defined range
* Threshold: limit the number of alert for a signature by specifying a number of alert for a time range or a minimum of alerts in a time range before alerting

Both operations can be accessed via a rule page. Clicking on a arrow down in the Source or Destination IP table will open a page where it is possible to add
a Threshold. By clicking on the cross, a Suppress operation can be added.

The list of Threshold and Suppress for a rule can be seen from the ``Rules info`` tab.

Threshold and Suppress are bound to a Ruleset. You can see all the defined ones from the Ruleset page.

To suppress or edit a Threshold or a Suppress, simply click on the displayed ID. Then select ``Edit`` or ``Delete``  in the left menu.

Updating Suricata ruleset
-------------------------

To update Suricata ruleset, you can go to ``Suricata -> Update`` (``Update`` being in the
``Actions`` menu). Then you have to select which action you want to do:

* Update: download latest version of the Sources used by the Ruleset
* Build: build a Suricata ruleset based on current version of the Sources
* Push: trigger a Suricata reload to have it running with latest build ruleset

You can also update the ruleset and trigger a Suricata reload by running ::

 python manage.py updatesuricata

Backup
======

To start a backup, run ::

 python manage.py scbackup

To restore a backup and erase all your data, you can run ::

 python manage.py screstore
 python manage.py migrate

This will restore the latest backup. To choose another backup, indicate a backup filename as first argument.
To get list of available backup, use ::

 python manage.py listbackups

You can not restore a backup to a scirius which is older than the one where the backup has been done.

With default configuration file, the backup is done on disk in `/var/backups` but other methods are available.
As Scirius is using django-dbbackup application for backup and restore procedures, it benefits from all available
methods in this application. This includes at least:

* FTP
* Amazon AWS
* Dropbox

Please see `django-dbbackup configuration <http://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.org/en/latest/storage.html>`_
for more information on available methods and on their configuration.
